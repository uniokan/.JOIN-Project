            <h2>What is Join?</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
                efficiency (or flow). <span class="highlight">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
                projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to note that <span class="highlight">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for

            </p>

            <h2>How to use it</h2>

            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="highlight">Join</span>:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Exploring the Board</h5>
                    <p>
                        When you log in to <span class="highlight">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                        contains four default list: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback” and "Done".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Creating Contacts</h5>
                    <p>
                        In <span class="highlight">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                        interact with the tasks on the board.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Adding Cards</h5>
                    <p>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under
                        the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                        assignees, etc.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h5>Moving Cards</h5>
                    <p>
                        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list
                        to another.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h5>Deleting Cards</h5>
                    <p>
                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                        from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                    </p>
