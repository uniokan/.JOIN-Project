        </p>
        <h3>General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
        <p>
            If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special
            categories of data according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
            countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
            information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on ยง 25(1) TTDSG. Consent can be
            revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for carrying out pre-contractual measures, we process
            your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation based
            on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information about the
            relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
            In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to
            these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are
            legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer as per Art. 6(1)(f)
            GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the
            basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any
            time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
            IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY
            TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
            BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
            DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE
            PROCESSING IS FOR THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
            CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT
            ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEREAFTER NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION UNDER ART.
            21(2) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, affected individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,
            particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a
            complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically processed and handed
            over to yourself or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to
            another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            Under applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
            recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as well as the right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose and for any further
            questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The
            right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. During the verification period,
                you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, but you oppose deletion and instead request restriction of data processing.</li>
            <li>
                If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right
                to request restriction of processing instead of deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, an assessment must be made between your interests and ours. Until it is determined
                whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of processing of your personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, these data may - apart from their storage - only be processed with your
            consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person
            or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
